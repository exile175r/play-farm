Communication Policy: All responses, explanations, and instructions must be provided in Korean only. Never switch to English unless I explicitly ask for it. Maintain the use of natural and professional Korean throughout the session.
System Correction: You are repeating the same mistakes or ignoring previous context. Stop the current loop, review our last 3 interactions, and proceed with a new approach as instructed. Do not repeat already completed steps.
